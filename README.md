# Proof of Presence

**Proof of Presence (PoP)** is a privacy-preserving protocol that allows individuals to prove *where they have been*—and for how long—without tracking them, exposing their identity, or surrendering control of their data.

Presence today is either undocumented or over-collected.

Passports prove nationality, not lived reality.  
GPS tracking is invasive and centralized.  
Databases own our movement instead of us.

Proof of Presence replaces tracking with **attestation**.

Individuals opt in at specific moments—such as arriving at an airport, attending an event, working on-site, or enrolling in a program—and receive a cryptographically signed presence attestation from a trusted issuer. Only a minimal proof is anchored on-chain. All sensitive details remain encrypted and under user control.

Over time, individual attestations can be aggregated into higher-level claims such as:

- “Present in Japan for 30 days”
- “On-site in the EU during Q2”
- “Attended five verified conferences”

Claims can be verified publicly without revealing identity, exact locations, or detailed timelines.

Proof of Presence is not an identity system.
It is not surveillance.
It is not a financial product.

It is a way to make lived reality provable—without turning life into a dataset.
